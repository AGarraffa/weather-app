Weather forecast in various cities



The user enters the city and country (and state if in the US) and the current weather is pulled up along with a 7 day forecast. 

## Current development: 
- formatting and styling
- adding functionality to the search history buttons
- adding an option for metric
- have the city field clear when the user clicks on it
- add images to the readme
